          Huda Beauty is a huge and luxury brand of cosmetics.
          On its website we can see that the products, its images, and prices are perfectly aligned 
          and we can easily identify which price, and name corresponds to each product.
          This characteristic makes the page useful and easy to understand. I'm sure that each person who
          searchs for a product and its price will be satisfied with the proximity of this website.

          One of the biggest companies nowadays is Netflix.
          Its website is the perfect example of contrast because of the great combination of black, red, and white 
          with a collage of movies as background. The background was perfectly designed so that visitors can read
          the texts in white without any problem or difficulty.

          Dasbenty is a small cosmetic business that recently developed its site.
          Even though its website is knew, the quality of the design is pretty good, and one of the things that 
          are really cool from it are the repetition of "sections", we can find a specific section of products
          for the face, the lips, the eyes, and more!
          Repetiton in this site is great because the client can find the category of the product that is interested
          more easy.
